Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that's a little different than CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma. We are going to build a Tailwind landing page so we can learn how quickly we can create designs for our sites.

## How to run in VSCode:
1.npm install tailwindcss

2.Create SRC file for style.css and add the lines mentioned below into that file 
                       
     @tailwind base;

     @tailwind components;

     @tailwind utilities;
                        
3.Then using live server open your index.html file.
